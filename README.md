# lightning_alert
This python script is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico WH to monitor local airport weather for indications of lightning. If lightning is detected, an alert is generated which turns on a flashing light for 30 minutes after the last indication of lightning.

As of 3/26/2024, this is incomplete and does not yet contain any Raspberry Pi Pico integration code yet.
